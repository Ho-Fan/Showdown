# Showdown

## Project Objective
This project originated from the need to learn C++ and Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA). The goal is to deepen the understanding of these concepts through practical application and to implement the learned knowledge in a real-world project.

## Technologies and Skills Practiced
- Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) using the Astah tool.
- Programming in the C++ language.
- Developing with the Visual Studio IDE.

## Functionality of the Project
The project is a Showdown poker card game with the following features:

### Player Composition
- Accommodates up to four players, which can be a mix of human players and AI players.
- Interaction for human players is through a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Deck and Cards
- Utilizes a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
- Each card has a rank and a suit, following traditional poker rules.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Players are named P1 through P4 and can enter their names.
- The game starts with shuffling the deck and players drawing 13 cards each.
- Players take turns to play cards, exchange hands, and score points.

### Card Rankings
- Cards are ranked from 2 to A, in ascending order of value.
- Suits are Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades.

### Determining the Winner
- The game is played over 13 rounds, and the player with the highest score wins.

## Installation and Running Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Getting the Project
Download the project files from the GitHub repository.

### Project Structure
- The `src` folder contains the source code.
- The `documents` folder contains additional project documentation.

### Running the Application
To run the project, execute the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `src` directory where the `main.cpp` file is located.
2. Compile the code using the following command (example for `g++`):
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o game
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     game.exe
     ```
   - On Unix-like systems:
     ```
     ./game
     ```

Follow the CLI prompts to interact with the game.

### Additional Gameplay Mechanics
- During each round, before playing a card, players have the option to use the "Exchange Hands" privilege. This privilege allows players to exchange their hand of cards with another player (not themselves) and can be used only once per game by each player.
- Once a player decides to use this privilege, they choose another player to exchange hands with.
- After the exchange, the hands are swapped back after three rounds.
- If a player finds themselves without any cards to play after an exchange, they are not required to play a card and cannot participate in the ranking contest for that round.
